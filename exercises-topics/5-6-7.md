Here are some exercises to practice functions, arrays, and strings in PHP:

**Functions:**
1. Create a function that calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
2. Write a function that determines if a given number is prime.
3. Develop a function that reverses a string.
4. Create a function that generates a random password of a specified length.
5. Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.

**Arrays:**
1. Create an array of numbers and calculate their sum.
2. Implement a program that finds the maximum and minimum values in an array.
3. Write a function that counts the occurrences of each element in an array.
4. Build a program that removes duplicate values from an array.
5. Create an array of names and sort them in alphabetical order.

**Strings:**
1. Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
2. Implement a function that truncates a long string if it's longer than a specified length.
3. Create a program that replaces all occurrences of a word in a string.
4. Develop a function that counts the number of vowels in a string.
5. Write a program that converts a sentence to "Title Case" (capitalize the first letter of each word).
